--Page feature list--
    Note: only listing key features below

(Login/registration) 
    1. Page should be created with login/registration from DojoTweets.

    3. Table should update both member section and the action section (reference wireframe for more details)(added some styling from w3 schools)
    4. Multiple pages should redirect event's listed within the table. (try to implement this using AJAX so page doesn't have to reload each time) 

(Event Info)
    1. Page redirects at top
    2. 3 different sections for info (reference wireframe for ideas)(Added clickable vertical tabs to display info idea still needs lots of work and needs to be updated with correct info)
