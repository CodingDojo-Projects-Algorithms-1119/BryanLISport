--Page feature list--
    Note: only listing key features below

(Login/registration) 
    1. Page should be created with login/registration from DojoTweets.  

    Note: See if you can figure out how to add a calendar so the user can click instead of typing in their birthdate. 

(Home page)
    1. Page redirects located at top
    2. User specific activities located on this page
    3. Upper right corner should have an account page redirect that will display message notification if any 
    4. Two tables; upper table should display if an event is being done that day lower table should display future events

(Event Search)
    1. Page redirects at top
    2. Search function should be accessible via text input (keyword) and dropdown menu(field type)
    3. Table should update both member section and the action section (reference wireframe for more details)(added some styling from w3 schools)
    4. Multiple pages should redirect event's listed within the table. (try to implement this using AJAX so page doesn't have to reload each time) 

(Event Info)
    1. Page redirects at top
    2. 3 different sections for info (reference wireframe for ideas)(Added clickable vertical tabs to display info idea still needs lots of work and needs to be updated with correct info)
    3. Message board located at the bottom of the screen

    Note: to show location; when creating new event add a form section that embeds a voluntary google map location see if you can use a google maps api that allows for user to add address and google maps shows proper address on event details page. 

(User info)
    1. Profile info should only be accessible to user logged in. 
    2. Page redirects at top of page
    4. text display of upcoming events
    5. Option to upload photo (ajax if possible or just use a page redirect if time is limited)
